# Capstone Project GreatLearning
A group work on a usecase of automatic ticketing system to make it more appropriate and automate as per the data set provided.

## Problem Statement
One of the key activities of any IT function is to “Keep the lights on” to ensure there is no impact to the 
Business operations. IT leverages Incident Management process to achieve the
above Objective. An incident is something that is unplanned interruption to an IT service or
reduction in the quality of an IT service that affects the Users and the Business. The main goal
of Incident Management process is to provide a quick fix / workarounds or solutions that resolves the 
interruption and restores the service to its full capacity to ensure no business impact. In most of the 
organizations, incidents are created by various Business and IT Users, End Users/ Vendors if they have 
access to ticketing systems, and from the integrated monitoring systems and tools. Assigning the 
incidents to the appropriate person or unit in the support team has critical importance to provide 
improved user satisfaction while ensuring better allocation of support resources. The assignment of 
incidents to appropriate IT groups is still a manual process in many of the IT organizations. Manual 
assignment of incidents is time consuming and requires human efforts. There may be mistakes due to 
human errors and resource consumption is carried out ineffectively because of
the misaddressing. On the other hand, manual assignment increases the response and resolution times 
which result in user satisfaction deterioration / poor customer service.

## Project Objectives
The objective of the project is,
- Learn how to use different classification models.
- Use transfer learning to use pre-built models.
- Learn to set the optimizers, loss functions, epochs, learning rate, batch size, checkpointing, early 
stopping etc.
- Read different research papers of given domain to obtain the knowledge of advanced models for 
the given problem.

## Goals
##### Pre-Processing, Data Visualization and EDA 
 - Exploring the given Data files
 - Understanding the structure of data
 - Missing points in data
 - Finding inconsistencies in the data
 - Visualizing different patterns 
 - Visualizing different text features
 - Dealing with missing values
 - Text preprocessing 
 - Creating word vocabulary from the corpus of report text data
 - Creating tokens as required 
##### Model Building
- Building a model architecture which can classify.
- Trying different model architectures by researching state of the art for similar tasks.
- Train the model
- To deal with large training time, save the weights so that you can use them when training the 
model for the second time without starting from scratch.
##### Test the Model, Fine-tuning and Repeat
 - Test the model and report as per evaluation metrics
 - Try different models
 - Try different evaluation metrics 
 - Set different hyper parameters, by trying different optimizers, loss functions, epochs, learning 
rate, batch size, checkpointing, early stopping etc..for these models to fine-tune them
 - Report evaluation metrics for these models along with your observation on how changing 
different hyper parameters leads to change in the final evaluation metric.
